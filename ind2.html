            <p class="parg">Scratch is a free visual programming language and 
                online community where anyone can create their own stories, games, and animations. We are so excited to share the many pathways 
                to participate in the Scratch global community!</p>

                <h2 class="title">Why Learn Scratch Programming?</h2>
                <p class="parg">Learning Scratch is so much fun! But that’s not all. As a block-based programming language, it makes coding concepts simple to learn with drag-and-drop code blocks. There’s no complex text-based syntax, so a kid 8+ can start their programming journey with ease.

                    Along with exercising their creativity muscles, kid coders are able to flex their problem-solving skills. Scratch serves as a great blend of logic and imagination. Want to build your own video game like Minecraft? It’s both entertaining & educational with Scratch!
                    
                    Along with gaining new skills in the basics of programming, Scratchers are given the opportunity to safely connect with a large online community. This allows them to explore other projects, find inspiration, and share their own creations.
                    
                    Learning programming is a fundamental building block of the careers of the future. Scratch makes it easy, providing young programmers the head start they need for STEM curriculum and their future aspirations!</p>

                    Even though Scratch is one of the easiest programming languages to learn, it can still feel a little intimidated at first.
                     Don’t fret! Take a look at the various tutorials 
                     and see if anything catches your eye.
                    
                    Starter projects, for instance, allow you to dive right in. 
                    You can also customize them to make them your own.
                     Once you feel more comfortable with sprites and coding blocks, 
                     you can try to make a Scratch project from scratch!</p>
